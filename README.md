This data is about working hours and shifts of employees in a company in three months. Each
label of working has its own meaning, and you can see the details in the Excel sheet. In this data,
we have all working days in three month “April”, “May” and “June” for all employees and it is written
that in each day what was the status of working in terms of HR management. Then based on the
rules in the company, they calculate some measures for each of the employees and they must
stick to the regulations. First understand the requirements of HR team:


1. The first requirement is that the HR manager wants to know what the preference of
working for employee. Are they willing to work from home or in the office and what reason
is behind that.

2. Second thing is HR team want to know the level of sickness to know whether the illness is
dangerous for other people (like Covid-19) to not.
